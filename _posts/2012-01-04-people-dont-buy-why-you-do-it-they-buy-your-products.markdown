I was recently introduced to Simon Sinek’s TEDx talk, [Start With Why][start-with-why], a perceptive and passionate talk about how companies influence consumers. While thought provoking, I felt that his talk was not entirely accurate.

Sinek’s point about Apple’s motivation, “to think differently”, has not been the case for many years. He is referring to the [Think Different][think-different] campaign of the late nineteen-nineties, which used evocative photographs and film of iconic figures of the 20th century to cast Apple as the self-styled “Crazy One” that would change the computer world. I don’t think Think Different has ever been Apple’s core motivation, I think this is one of their tools – a “How”, in Sinek’s words. Apple routinely applies divergent strategies in their business, their marketing and their products, but it is not their reason for being.

So, what is Apple’s “Why”? Apple makes consumer appliances. Therefore, is motivated by producing the best products from the perspective of consumers. This has been true of Apple since the beginning, and is true of all of their greatest successes even today. A hallmark of every Apple competitor in an established market is the re-invention of a specialist device as a marketable consumer product. People don’t buy why you do it, they buy your products.

However, when he comes around to apply the reasoning to attracting talent, he does correctly state that prospective employees are attracted by the identity of a company. Identity is a key part of a company’s market, its products, its employees. Identity defines how employees are trained, it defines which markets it chooses to expand into, it defines how new ideas are developed and how they are sold. Identity is a key part of building a company as a system, and plays an important part in everything you’ve ever done and all that you are going to do next.

What makes Apple’s example so compelling is not that they have had one super-successful product in iPod alone. It is that they have managed to launch successful products consistently, often in markets that they have little experience in and against considerable opposition. Apple uses Think Different, stylish design and intuitive interfaces to build a new product, and then uses unrivalled customer support and service to win the long-term support of those that they win over. It is this long-term success that is so remarkable.

Apple will stop being successful one day. It may come sooner or later, but when it does happen it will be because its identity is irrelevant or because its processes have ceased to create products that its customers want. That is what is troubling Microsoft, RIM and now Nintendo. Identity and relevance are key factors in the long-term successes and failures of any company. If you get it wrong, you will have hard questions to ask about your future. Get it right, however, your products stand a great chances of striking a chord with all who make them and, crucially, all who buy them.
