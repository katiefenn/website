In its latest release of its web browser, Firefox 23, Mozilla has [removed the option to disable JavaScript](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/23.0/releasenotes/) from the user interface. It's still a configurable option that can be changed in the browser's about:config interface, so professional and enthusiast users shouldn't have a problem.

A [debate is unfolding at Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/firefox-23-lands-with-a-new-logo-and-mixed-content-blocking/?comments=1) regarding this decision, and the wider merits of JavaScript on the web.

Some are claiming JavaScript is unnecessary, that "pure HTML with CSS is sufficient for the functional needs of about 95% of the web". Others support the use of JavaScript as its capabilities can be used to design more sophisticated interfaces and deliver an effective user experience. One person even slams web developers' use of JavaScript as a "divine right to execute scripts in my browser" that should be resisted.

I'm sure that 95% of the internet doesn't _need_ JavaScript. After all, a significant proportion of the internet is porn, and that certainly can't be made better with JavaScript. I'm also a huge proponent of the power of the web to spread news and empower communities; custom-designed select boxes sure as hell aren't necessary for that.

However, I'd argue that JavaScript has become very important for 95% of the web by traffic: Facebook, Twitter, Google Mail. JavasScript is used on these websites to meaningfully enhance the user experience. Such enhancements are routinely required by people paying for websites, although they are also often paying for the guidance to use JavaScript wisely.

JavaScript _is_ and _should be_ an integral part of the web, and Mozilla is right to withdraw this option from the consumer user. User stories rarely state legacy devices as the reason for supporting the absence of JavaScript. In fact the last time I was given this requirement it was specified in the context of users disabling JavaScript in otherwise functional browsers. I won't deny that there are use cases for websites that operate without JavaScript, but those use cases are now rare.

Custom-design select boxes are still entirely unnecessary, though.
